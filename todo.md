### extra
- todos from README.md

### Algebra and Number Theory
- Symmetric group operations in cpp? (why?)
- factorization as in Number Field
- is_prime AKS?
- integer relation algorithms implementation or fu use

### DLP
- Pollard dlp improve
- collision algos improve
- index calculus
- auxilary inputs
- prime power mod - two files merge
- smooth criminal - wtf

### RSA
- coppersmith. Bivariate too you little fuck.
- why does cpp algo on pkcs works in less oracls calls?
- test it on general values
- Gaussian Wiener
- openssl + asn - cringe now

### Elliptic Curves
- Smart attack
- Babai
- ecdsa attacks
    - LLL higher bits + middle
    - Random things
- Mongomery ladder

### Lattice Cryptography
- ntru signature complete
- cpp LLL does not solve large lattices. still don't know why
- trust games - explore
- lwe - explore

### Stream Ciphers
- RC4
    - Determine why does the 2nd byte doesn't work in the 1st round attack. And for now determine why it doesn't happen anymore
    - Cope with the ugly swaps with specific keys
    - Finish the 2nd round attack
    - chosen IV attack on rc4

    - brix

### Block Ciphers
- Feistel
- AES
    - implementation check, maybe c
    - gcm - mess directory

### Linear Cryptoanalisys
- Kek
- ces - solve

### ZKP
- Imlement py_pairing and all this twisted stuff by myself
- bulletproofs?
- protostar

### Algebraic Things
- number of els to the corresponding order
- jordan general form + analyzing lfsr

### TOOLS
- check the pseudoprime gen file
- carmichael numbers file is ridiculous
- polynomial roots modulo prime power debug or test or smth
- math - implement some algos from my textbook. sum_of_squares doesn't work properl- Cheng's factorization method
- ROCA
- x509 - cringe

### PRNG
- well...
- mersenne goes wild

### polynomials
- finish grobner basis

### HASH FUNCTIONS 
- md5 diffrential
- rainbow
