### extra
- todos from README.md
- chacha?
- sage compilation 
- cvc5 compilation

### Algebra and Number Theory
- Symmetric group operations in cpp? (why?)
- factorization as in Number Field
- is_prime AKS?
- integer relation algorithms implementation or fu use

### DLP
- index calculus
- auxilary inputs

### RSA
- coppersmith. Bivariate too you little fuck.
- why does cpp algo on pkcs works in less oracls calls?
- test it on general values
- Gaussian Wiener
- openssl + asn - cringe now
- ROCA

### Elliptic Curves
- elliptic curves over the rings
- anomalous curves generation
- Babai
- ecdsa attacks
    - LLL higher bits + middle
    - Random things
- Montgomery ladder
- get_curves_of_specific_order.py - finish this one
- multiplication
    - endomorphism
    - tau expansion
    - windowed
    - check the book

### Lattice Cryptography
- ntru signature complete
- cpp LLL does not solve large lattices. still don't know why
- trust games - explore
- lwe - explore
- sparse knapsacks

### Stream Ciphers
- RC4
    - Determine why does the 2nd byte doesn't work in the 1st round attack. And for now determine why it doesn't happen anymore
    - Cope with the ugly swaps with specific keys
    - Finish the 2nd round attack
    - chosen IV attack on rc4

    - brix

### Block Ciphers
- Feistel
- AES
    - implementation check, maybe c
    - https://toadstyle.org/cryptopals/63.txt
- des some analysis
- idea? whatever blowfish

### Linear Cryptoanalisys
- Kek
- ces - solve

### ZKP
- Imlement py_pairing and all this twisted stuff by myself
- bulletproofs?
- protostar
- finish zcash

### Algebraic Things
- number of els to the corresponding order
- jordan general form + analyzing lfsr
- annihilators - more efficient one?

### TOOLS
- check the pseudoprime gen file
- carmichael numbers file is ridiculous
- polynomial roots modulo prime power debug or test or smth
- math - implement some algos from my textbook. sum_of_squares doesn't work properl- Cheng's factorization method
- ROCA
- x509 - cringe
- montgomery multiplication - finish
- fibonacci heap

### PRNG
- well...
- mersenne goes wild - PYTHON INCLUDING
- xoshiro256mulmul.py

### Post quantum

- check the rest of UoV paper

### polynomials
- finish grobner basis

### HASH FUNCTIONS 
- blake2s
- md5 fastcoll
- rainbow
- finish murmurhash subrepo and clean up
- finish tau_expansion
- finish factorization/p1
