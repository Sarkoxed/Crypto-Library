Follows:
    The second stream byte is 0 more often than the t = f(K[0], K[1], K[2])

Precedes:
    Bigger length of IV(and more random) -> better result with the less number of calls

Chosen IV:
    IV's are chosen such that S[1] after IV + known is equal to len(IV) + len(known). Hence the first stream byte will be predictible with high probability
