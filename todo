Weil Pairing And Miller Algorithm(doesn't work)
attacks on lattices



ntru signature complete
cpp LLL does not solve large lattices. still don't know why
check the smart attack

integer relation algorithms implementation or fu use

coppersmith. Bivariate too you little fuck.

RC4
Determine why does the 2nd byte doesn't work in the 1st round attack
Cope with the ugly swaps with specific keys
Fix the attack with IV preceding key
Finish the 2nd round attack
